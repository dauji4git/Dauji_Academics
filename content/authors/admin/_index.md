#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Us

Dauji Academics was established as a sole proprietorship firm in December 2024. The firm was established, and is managed by Dauji Saha (Ph.D.), after his voluntary retirement from Bhabha Atomic Research Centre & Homi Bhabha National Institute. The firm strives to provide quality services in diverse academic activities, research, and structural engineering. Further details are available here [Services](https://dauji4git.github.io/Dauji_Academics/services/). 

## Vision

To educate, collaborate, and innovate for excellence in academics, research, and engineering.  

## Mission

To provide inspired, and timely services for each assignment.  

## A few words about me .....

With an extensive experience in residential, industrial, and nuclear safety-related civil engineering projects, spanning over 27 years, I have taken voluntary retirement from service in November 2024. Details of my earlier employment are available on this website.

During the last 15 years, I have broadened my field of operations into research and developmental works. I was fortunate to be involved in addressing several practical problems of civil and ocean engineering, in collaborative research activities. I have further enhanced my portfolio with individual research to meet the challenges of civil engineering, using statistical and machine learning approaches.

I have retired from service, but not from work. I am retired, but I am not tired. I am therefore offering freelance support for a variety of services, and more details are available on the ‘Services’ page.

Please reach out to collaborate.
