abstract = {Whereas international codes stipulate probabilistic characteristic strength of concrete, acceptance criterion for concrete produced with non-potable water remain deterministic. Compatible to defined characteristic strength, first probabilistic acceptance criterion is proposed for such concrete. Considering 9000 possible combinations, minimum allowable ratio was infeasible (32 %); 0.90 (49 %); and 4 % fell between each range: 0.90–0.92; 0.92–0.94; 0.94–0.96; 0.96–0.98; and 0.98–1.00. Tables of minimum allowable ratio of mean strength of reference and test concrete are provided for seamless integration into practice within prevalent framework of international codes. This would improve regulator confidence, reduce water stress from concrete, and contribute towards Sustainable Development Goals 2030.}
